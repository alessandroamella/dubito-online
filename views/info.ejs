                    <p>Lo scopo del gioco consiste nello scartare tutte le proprie carte e vince chi per primo raggiunge
                        questo
                        obiettivo.</p>

                    <p>Inizia a giocare il giocatore a sinistra del mazziere scartando a sua scelta una ed una soltanto
                        delle sue
                        carte tenendole coperte ma dichiarandone il valore presunto di cui appunto gli altri giocatori
                        potranno
                        dubitare. Chi scarta può quindi lecitamente mentire circa il valore delle carte ma nel caso di
                        scarto
                        multiplo deve comunque dichiarare che le carte siano tutte dello stesso valore (per esempio, due
                        7,o tre
                        re...).</p>

                    <p>Se nessuno dubita della veridicità della dichiarazione le carte vengono depositate in mucchio che
                        non potrà
                        essere consultato e toccherà al giocatore successivo che dovrà scartare a sua volta da una a tre
                        carte
                        uguali a quelle del giocatore precedente (per esempio se il precedente aveva
                        dichiarato due 5, il giocatore successivo dovrà dichiarare almeno da uno a tre 5).</p>

                    <p>Il gioco continua similarmente ad ogni turno fino a che uno dei giocatori finisce le sue carte
                        vincendo
                        appunto la partita.</p>

                    <p>Il fulcro del gioco è la mossa del "Dubito!". Infatti al termine dello scarto e della
                        dichiarazione di un
                        giocatore uno qualsiasi degli avversari può, se ritiene che la dichiarazione sia falsa,
                        dichiararlo
                        esplicitamente dicendo appunto "Dubito!". A questo punto si verificherà la veridicità della
                        dichiarazione
                        con due possibili esiti. Se il dichiarante aveva detto il vero il dubitatore verrà penalizzato
                        con la
                        raccolta di tutte le carte scartate fino a quel momento; viceversa se invece il giocatore che ha
                        dubitato ha
                        scoperto il bluff dell'avversario sarà quest'ultimo a venir penalizzato alla stessa maniera.</p>

                    <p>Nessun giocatore può passare il proprio turno di gioco.</p>
